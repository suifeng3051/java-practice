           User interface and instantiating one (instead of hardcoding
           it to UserImpl as we have done here.)  We could also do the
           same for the InvocationHandler - this way we could choose 
           the implementation of the InvocationHandler at runtime rather
           than always using the BusinessObjectInvocationHandler type.
           
           Also, in this example, the only interface that is implemented is
           the User interface (and all super-interfaces.)  We could
           specify a collection of interfaces to implement here as long as
           our InvocationHandler knew how to handle requests to these
           interfaces.
